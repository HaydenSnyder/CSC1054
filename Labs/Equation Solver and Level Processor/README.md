# Equation Solver and Level Processor

## Overview
This project consists of two parts:

### Equation Solver**
A program that takes two integers and an operator (* or /), performs the calculation, and handles input errors gracefully.
### Level Processor
A file processing program that reads a level configuration from a file, modifies the data, and writes the updated level back to a new file.
