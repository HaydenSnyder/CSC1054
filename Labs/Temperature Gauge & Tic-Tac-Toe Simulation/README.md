# Temperature Gauge & Tic-Tac-Toe Program

## Description

### 1. TemperatureGauge Class
A class that models a temperature gauge with restrictions on temperature values (-30°F to 180°F). It provides methods to set and retrieve temperature values in both Fahrenheit and Celsius. A client program demonstrates object creation, temperature adjustments, and conversions.

### 2. Tic-Tac-Toe Game
