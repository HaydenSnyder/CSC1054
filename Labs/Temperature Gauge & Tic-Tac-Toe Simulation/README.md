# Temperature Gauge & Tic-Tac-Toe Program

This Java program consists of two parts:

### Part I: Person Class
The Person class models a person with attributes for name, age, ID, and a static count. It includes methods for equality checking (equals), converting the object to a string (toString), and a static method for tracking how many people have been created. The client creates and prints out multiple instances, comparing them using equals and == operators.

### Part II: Train Simulation
The Train and TrainSystem classes simulate a two-train system where trains move left or right in a circular track. The trains crash if they occupy the same position. The program tracks and displays each move, printing out the state of the train system after each action.
