# Lab 6: Painting and Layouts  

## Overview  
This project explores JavaFX layouts, GUI design, and file-based shape rendering. It consists of three main parts:  


### Creating a Green and Yellow Checkerboard 
In this part, we create a **7x6 checkerboard** consisting of green and yellow squares. The squares are dynamically arranged inside a **FlowPane**, which allows them to reposition when the window is resized.  

### Experimenting with Panes 
This part focuses on understanding JavaFX pane layouts by constructing a complex **GUI hierarchy**. The goal is to experiment with different pane types and how they interact when nested inside one another.  

### Reading and Executing Paint Commands
In this part, the program **reads shape-drawing commands from a file** and renders them dynamically on a **600x600 canvas**. The input file specifies different shapes (circles and squares) along with their position, size, and color.
