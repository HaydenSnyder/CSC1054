# Temperature Gauge & Tic-Tac-Toe Program

This Java program consists of two parts:

## 1. TemperatureGauge Class
A class that models a temperature gauge with restrictions on temperature values (from -30째F to 180째F). It provides methods to set and retrieve temperature values in both Fahrenheit and Celsius. The program ensures that temperatures cannot be set outside the defined range. A client program demonstrates object creation, temperature adjustments, and conversions between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

### Features:
- **Temperature Range**: Ensures temperatures are within the specified range of -30째F to 180째F.
- **Conversion Methods**: Includes methods for converting between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
- **Temperature Adjustment**: Allows adjusting the temperature and retrieving it in both Fahrenheit and Celsius.

## 2. Tic-Tac-Toe Game
A simplified Tic-Tac-Toe game class that manages the first four moves of a game. It ensures that players cannot overwrite existing moves or place marks out of bounds. The game tracks turns, displays the board, and prompts players for valid moves using a loop until four moves are made.

### Features:
- **Move Validation**: Ensures players cannot overwrite existing moves or place marks out of bounds.
- **Turn Tracking**: Tracks whose turn it is and alternates between players.
- **Board Display**: Displays the current state of the Tic-Tac-Toe board after each move.
- **User Interaction**: Prompts players for valid moves and checks for game validity.
