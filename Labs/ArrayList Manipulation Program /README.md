# ArrayList Manipulation Program in Java

A Java program that demonstrates the use of an ArrayList to store and manipulate a list of strings. The program allows users to input strings into an ArrayList until they type "EXIT." Then, it provides a menu where users can add, remove, clear, or print elements in the list. The program ensures valid input when removing items by index.
