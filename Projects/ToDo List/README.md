# Java To-Do List Application

This project is a simple To-Do List application built using JavaFX. It allows users to manage tasks by selecting a day of the week, adding tasks, and marking tasks as completed or not completed. The tasks are displayed with a color-coded status, and users can easily switch between different days to view their tasks.

## Features

- **Day Selection:** Users can select a day of the week (Monday to Sunday) from a dropdown (ComboBox) and view or add tasks for that specific day.
- **Add Tasks:** Users can enter a task in a text field and click "Add Task" to add the task to the selected day's list.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed:** Each task has a dropdown (ComboBox) to mark it as either "Not Completed" or "Completed," with the task color updating accordingly (green for completed).
- **Task Persistence per Day:** Each day has its own list of tasks, and switching days will load and display the tasks for the selected day.
- **Simple User Interface:** A clean and easy-to-navigate interface for managing tasks.
